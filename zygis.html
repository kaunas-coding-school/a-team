        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
            will
            give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
            truth,
            the master-builder of human happiness.</p>

        <p>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
            know
            how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
            anyone
            who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
            circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>

        <p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
            advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has
            no
            annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we
            denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee </p>

                <p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For
                    science,
                    music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar,
                    their
                    pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be
                    desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to
                    have
                    uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of
                    the
                    resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. </p>

                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a
                    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able
                    to
                    cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the
                    size
                    of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.</p>
